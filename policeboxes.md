### Hey! Welcome to my police box hunt
#### I'm really into police boxes and I've been documenting them for the past year. Welcome to my journey :) 

About two years ago I bought a book about police boxes at [Typewronger Bookshop](https://www.typewronger.com/), and it has kickstarted this whole thing. I'm intrigued by the premise that police boxes can be repurposed to become spaces for community and engagement so I've started documenting the existing police boxes in Edinburgh.

I've been documenting this journey by creating my own map of Edinburgh's police boxes-- I draw from the police boxes listed in the book "From Cuffs to Community" by Photina_dk and add or update the location of police boxes as needed. The layout of the book has also allowed me to begin a small journal project and I document each police box I visit and sometimes draw diagrams of the urban layout and ideas I come up with for how the police box could facilitate community engagement in the area. 



#### Check out my map:

#### How do I navigate this map?
+ Every pin represents a police box and they have been colour-coded depending on their status:
  + Light green = This police box is part of the book's reference and I've already logged it in my journal
  + Dark green = this police box is **not** part of the book's reference, but I found it (either on my own or by someone's tip) and I've already visited and logged it in my journal.
  + Orange = This police box is part of the book's reference but I have not visited it yet, the police box may or may not exist in the location of the dropped pin.
  + Purple = I have not visited this police box yet **and it is not listed within the book's reference**. I know the box exists because I have seen or heard about it from someone else, but I've not logged it yet.
  + Black = the police box no longer exists (rip).
+ Each police box is named after the street where they are located.
+ This map is updated periodically.
+ For more information about the book's reference see data source.
